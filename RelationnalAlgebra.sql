-- Relational Algebra is a formal system for manipulating relational databases.
-- It provides a way of specifying and executing queries on relational databases.
-- Relational Algebra is based on a set of operators that can be combined to form more complex queries.
-- It is used in Database Management Systems (DBMS) to support the querying of relational databases.

-- The basic set of operators in Relational Algebra are:
-- 1. Selection (sigma): Selects a subset of tuples from a relation based on a condition.
-- 2. Projection (pi): Selects a subset of columns from a relation.
-- 3. Union (cup): Combines two relations into one.
-- 4. Difference (-): Returns the tuples that are in one relation but not in another.
-- 5. Cartesian product (cross): Combines two relations into one by forming all possible pairs of tuples.
-- 6. Join (bow tie): Combines two relations into one by forming all possible pairs of tuples based on a common attribute.
-- 7. Rename (rho): Renames a relation.
-- 8. Aggregate functions: Performs calculations on a relation, such as sum, average, and count.

-- The Relational Algebra is a powerful tool for querying relational databases.
-- It is used in DBMS to support the querying of relational databases.
-- Relational Algebra is used in many applications, such as data analysis, data mining, and decision support systems.
